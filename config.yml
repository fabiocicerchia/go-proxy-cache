  timeout:

    # body.
    # Because it does not let Handlers make per-request decisions on each
    # request body's acceptable deadline or upload rate, most users will prefer
    # to use `read_header`. It is valid to use them both.
    read: 5s
    # It is the amount of time allowed to read request headers. The connection's
    # read deadline is reset after reading the headers and the Handler can
    # decide what is considered too slow for the body. If it is zero, the value
    # of `read` is used. If both are zero, there is no timeout.
    read_header: 2s
    # It is the maximum duration before timing out writes of the response. It is
    # reset whenever a new request's header is read. Like `read`, it does not
    # let Handlers make decisions on a per-request basis.
    write: 5s
    # It is the maximum amount of time to wait for the next request when
    # keep-alives are enabled. If is zero, the value of `read` is used. If both
    # ara zero, there is no timeout.

  #  - If the max-age response directive is present, use its value, or
  #  - If the Expires response header field is present, use its value minus the
  #    value of the Date response header field, or
  #  - Otherwise, no explicit expiration time is present in the response.
  #    A heuristic freshness lifetime might be applicable.
  # Default: 0
  ttl: 0

  allowed_statuses:
