## Features

- Full Page Caching (via Redis)
- Load Balancing (only Round-Robin)
- `PURGE` Method to invalidate
- HTTP & HTTPS Forward Traffic
- HTTP/2 Support
- SSL/TLS Certificates via ACME
- HTTP to HTTPS Redirects
- Using your own SSL/TLS Certificates (optional)
- Small, Pragmatic and Easy to Use
- Easily Configurable (via YAML or Environment Variables)
- Healthcheck Endpoint (`/healthcheck`)
- Cache respecting HTTP Headers `Vary`, `Cache-Control` and `Expires`
- Self-Contained, does not require Go, Git or any other software installed. Just run the binary or the container.
- Tested (Unit, Functional & Linted & 0 Race Conditions Detected)
- Support Chunking (by replicating exactly the same original amount)
- Cache Circuit Breaker, bypassing Redis when not available
- GZip Compression (optional)
- Multiple domains
- Configure log verbosity level
- Configure error handler (stdout or file)

## Configuration

For more details about the server configuration check the relative documentation in [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](https://github.com/fabiocicerchia/go-proxy-cache/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md)

## Examples

For examples check the relative documentation in [docs/EXAMPLES.md](https://github.com/fabiocicerchia/go-proxy-cache/blob/main/docs/EXAMPLES.md)

## Common Errors

- `acme/autocert: server name component count invalid`  
  Let's Encrypt cannot be used locally, as described in [this thread](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/can-i-test-lets-encrypt-client-on-localhost/15627)
- `acme/autocert: missing certificate`  
  Let's Encrypt cannot be used locally, as described in [this thread](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/can-i-test-lets-encrypt-client-on-localhost/15627)
- `501 Not Implemented`  
  If there's no domain defined in the main configuration nor in the domain overrides, and a client will request an
  unknown domain the status `501` is returned.
